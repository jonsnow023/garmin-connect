📱 What Is Garmin Connect?
Garmin Connect is Garmin’s official mobile app and web platform for:

Syncing fitness data

Creating and managing routes (courses)

Updating device software

Viewing historical activities

Sharing performance data with third-party apps like Strava or Komoot

It acts as a hub between your smartphone and Garmin device.

🗺️ Does Garmin Connect Update Maps?
No, Garmin Connect does not directly update full maps stored on your watch or GPS device. Instead, it is used to:

Create and edit routes (courses) using a built-in map tool

Sync routes to compatible devices (e.g., Fenix 7, Forerunner 965, Edge series)

Transfer waypoints, points of interest (POIs), and segments

So while you don’t “update maps” inside Garmin Connect like you would with Garmin Express, you can update the content that appears on your maps—like new routes or trail corrections.

🔁 Garmin Connect Map Update: What You Can Actually Do
✅ 1. Create or Edit a Course
Use the Garmin Connect mobile app or web platform

Choose a route type (running, cycling, hiking, etc.)

Plot your course using built-in mapping tools

Save and name your course

✅ 2. Send Course to Device
After saving a route, choose "Send to Device"

Your connected Garmin watch or bike computer will sync the course

You can now follow it using breadcrumb navigation or full maps (if supported)

✅ 3. Update a Course or Route
Edit the existing course in Garmin Connect

Re-sync it to your device to overwrite the old one

This acts as a "map update" by refreshing the route details

📝 Note: Devices like Garmin Fenix, Epix, and Edge cycling units support full maps, while basic models like the Forerunner 55 only support breadcrumb navigation.

⚙️ How to Sync Courses for Navigation
Open Garmin Connect (app or web)

Navigate to Training > Courses

Select or create your course

Tap “Send to Device”

Sync your Garmin device (via Bluetooth or USB)

Now your updated route will be ready to use during your workout or adventure.

🌍 How to Actually Update Maps (If Your Device Supports It)
If your goal is to update full topographic or road maps, you’ll need:

Garmin Express (for PC or Mac)

A compatible device (Fenix 7, Epix, Forerunner 965, Edge 1040, etc.)

Sufficient storage space or microSD (if needed)

Garmin Connect does not update stored maps, but works together with Garmin Express to manage map-related content.

✅ Conclusion
While the Garmin Connect map update doesn't directly change the maps on your watch or GPS unit, it plays a vital role in managing route updates, course syncing, and navigation planning. For actual map data updates, use Garmin Express with a compatible device. Still, Garmin Connect is essential for keeping your routing content current and tailored to your activities.
